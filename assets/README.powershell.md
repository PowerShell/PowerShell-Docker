## About This Image

PowerShell Core is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS) automation and configuration tool/framework.
It works well with your existing tools and is optimized
for dealing with structured data (for example, JSON, CSV, and XML), REST APIs, and object models.
It includes a command-line shell, an associated scripting language, and a framework for processing cmdlets.

If you are new to PowerShell and want to learn more, see the [getting started][] documentation.

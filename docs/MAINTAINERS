    [Org."Core maintainers"]

    # The Core maintainers are the ghostbusters of the project: when there's a problem others
    # can't solve, they show up and fix it with bizarre devices and weaponry.
    # They have final say on technical implementation and coding style.
    # They are ultimately responsible for quality in all its forms: usability polish,
    # bugfixes, performance, stability, etc. When ownership  can cleanly be passed to
    # a subsystem, they are responsible for doing so and holding the
    # subsystem maintainers accountable. If ownership is unclear, they are the de facto owners.

    [Org.Curators]

    # The curators help ensure that incoming issues and pull requests are properly triaged and
    # that our various contribution and reviewing processes are respected. With their knowledge of
    # the repository activity, they can also guide contributors to relevant material or
    # discussions.
    # They are never expected to merge. They can however:
    # - close an issue or pull request when it's an exact duplicate
    # - close an issue or pull request when it's inappropriate or off-topic
    # - make initial reviews for issues such as syntax errors and basic issues in code/docs

    # This list contains maintainers that are no longer active.
    # It is thanks to these people that the project has become what it is today.
